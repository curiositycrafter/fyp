go download fer 2013 dataset use that for this and then use preprocessing to preprocess it
and then use camcheck to check if ur cam works or not try changing that 0 to 1 or 2 to make it work ok?
and then proceed to training.py it will take like 5 min hardly if u have a good computer/laptop and 
then try out eval.py to check for its accuracy rate and then move to
emo3.py it will detect emotions via cam and then show a globe like thing that shows different colours based on emotions.


you are all set then thats all.

cheers!!! bye
